I created a travel blog website with Laravel. Most of the styling is done with Tailwind. there are categories of the country in a dropdown that keeps your choice selected. There is also search input for the title author or in the body text which can be used with a category or without. An Adim can be assigned and then has a dashboard where he can create, delete or update
a blog post also with images that can be loaded and shown at the correct post. users can comment on these posts once they are registered and logged in. furthermore there is a newsletter linked with Mailchimp. I try to make everything in separate components so there is less repetition and lots of dynamics. Keep my queries to the database as short as possible to improve speed en of course caching the posts.
